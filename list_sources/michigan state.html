<p>As a community-based medical school, one goal of the College of Human Medicine is to conduct collaborative, multidisciplinary and multi-community research that takes advantage of our unique distributed campus system.</p>
<p>Our focus is on both clinical research that can be practically applied, as well as the critical research in the basic science departments affiliated with the college on mechanisms underlying human diseases and their integration. These basic science departments include Epidemiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Microbiology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Neuroscience, Genetics, Pharmacology, and Physiology.</p>
<p>The extensive research being conducted within CHM provides students with opportunities for participating in research across a wide array of disciplines and settings. Faculty investigators in both the clinical and basic science departments serve as valuable mentors. Moreover, CHM is uniquely positioned to offer research experiences unlike most other medical schools, in two important ways.<br/><br/><img alt="research" caption="false" class="" height="181" src="../_assets/images/IMG_4223.JPG" style="float: right;" width="272"/>First, MSU is the only university in the US to be home to three medical schools: CHM, the College of Osteopathic Medicine and the College of Veterinary Medicine. The collaborations that exist between these Colleges, as well as with the Colleges of Nursing, Engineering, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Agriculture and Natural Resources, produce ground-breaking, multidisciplinary research that responds to our society's real-life needs. Teams that bring together bioengineering, medicine, and zoology are just one example of the research projects underway at MSU.<br/><br/>Second, CHM's community-based system provides access to a large base of clinicians, mentors, and patients who participate in research designed to translate findings from bench to bedside. CHM has multiple units engaged in research.</p>

<p>The Michigan State University Board of Trustees authorized MSU administration to enter into a Public Private Partnership (P3) for the continued development of the <a href="https://innovationparkgr.msu.edu/">Grand Rapids Innovation Park</a> site. Located just down the block from the Secchia Center, the site was established to advance MSU&#8217;s efforts in improving human health.<img alt="GRRC" caption="false" height="247" src="../_assets/images/GRRC-Phase-II-Map.jpg" style="float: right; border-width: 2px;" width="250"/></p>
<p>The first phase of the innovation park<a href="http://humanmedicine.msu.edu/Buildings_and_Facilities/GRRC-Phase-I-Project-Updates.htm"></a> was construction of a six-story, 162,800-square-foot facility that opened in the fall of 2017 and houses basic and translational science research teams<a href="http://humanmedicine.msu.edu/Buildings_and_Facilities/GRRC-Researcher-Bios.htm"></a> recruited from around the nation and the world by MSU. The areas of emphasis align with the biggest challenges to the health of our state and our nation including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, autism, women&#8217;s health and cancer.&#160;</p>
<p>Today, the confluence of the completion of the <a href="https://innovationparkgr.msu.edu/grand-rapids-research-center/index.html">Grand Rapids Research Center</a>, Michigan State University&#8217;s Global Impact Initiative, successful community and industry partnerships, and a new dean&#8217;s vision for the transformation of health, has set the stage for the Phase II expansion. The 200,000 square foot <a href="https://innovationparkgr.msu.edu/doug-meijer-medical-innovation-building/index.html">Doug Meijer Medical Innovation Building</a> is currently being constructed, scheduled to open in 2021.</p>
